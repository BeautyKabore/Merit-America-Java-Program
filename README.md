# Merit-America-Java-Program

Hi y'all,

I am Beauty Kabore and this repository mostly consist of various Java projects/assignments which I worked on during a six months Coding Bootcamp.

Each project implements various java concepts in an easy to understand format.

You would find some few html/CSS projects as well. 

Look around and let me know your thoughts.

Regards,
